# SimpleWave QSO Logger

The SimpleWave QSO Logger is a lightweight web application that allows users to log basic QSO data and geocode it using the Leaflet API. The app displays a map with pins representing worked stations and provides a table for the QSO data. You can export your data as an ADIF file for easy upload to QRZ, LOTW, eQSL, or other platforms that support ADIF files. You can also download a JPG of your the QSO map to use for bragging rights with your radio friends. **Be sure to export your log at the end of each session, as data cannot be saved within the app.** This tool is designed for quick, user-friendly logging that integrates easily with your logbook of choice.

## Implementation

### Option 1: Direct Source File Use
- Add the source files to your website.
- A web server such as **NGINX** or **Apache** is required. Running the files from a user directory will not work.
- Be sure the source files are placed in the same directory.

### Option 2: Docker Implementation
A quick implentation utilizing NodeJS is being developed.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to **N3FJP** for the inspiration, friendship, and knowledge. Go support Scott‚Äôs software instead of using this simple logger!

Special thanks to all my amateur radio teachers and mentors: N3LPV, N3TRX, KB3IVS, KI7Z, KA3YJM, KC3SVR, K2EJ, N3VEJ.
And many others I may have forgotten. Without you, I‚Äôd still be trying to work VHF with an aluminum dipole in a tree instead going on this journey of developing applications for radio operators.

73 and enjoy!
